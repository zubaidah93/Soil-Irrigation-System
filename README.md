This is part of my MS thesis work. This code mainly uses soil moisture sensor,ESP Soil Moisture Sensor, read the soil moisture and report the soil moisture state,
 either dry, good, wet (over irrigated).
The sensor is connected to the WIFI and publish the data to Thingspeak.com. The robot's microcomputer (RaspberryPi) is subscribed to the channel
and thus read and print the data on the robot screen. Of course, the work is done wirelessly. 
 This serves as part of autonomous farming, or semi-autonomous farming.
